# Mike's x86-64 Assembly (ASM) Notes

## Assembling Binary Machine Code

### Operating `Modes`:

These determine the assumed/default size of instruction operands,
and restricts which opcodes are available, and how they are used.

Modern operating systems, booted inside `Real` mode,
must escalate first to `Protected` mode, and then `Long` mode,
as support and capability is detected. This is done to remain backward-compatible.

This means modern applications run exclusively in `Long` 64-bit mode.

Mode|Default Operand Size|Default Address Size|Description
-|-|-|-
[`Long`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_mode) | `32`-bit | `64`-bit | Latest.
[`Protected`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode) | `32`-bit | `32`-bit | Legacy. Introduced segment registers (protected virtual addresses).
[`Real`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode) | `16`-bit | `16`-bit | Legacy. Unlimited direct access to addressable memory. Compatible with oldest x86 CPUs.

There are also modes called [`Virtual 8086`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_8086_mode) and [`Long Compatbility`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAMD64#Operating_modes) which are middle steps that emulate the previous mode. They are meant for backward-compatibility and are provide fast context-switching for multi-tasking. (ie. So you can run 32-bit applications in a 64-bit operating system.)

### Data Types:

Common variations you'll see:

Type    | Bits | Bytes | Aliases
--------|------|-------|------------
n/a     | 4    | Â½    | nibble, semioctet (rarely mentioned)
`BYTE`  | 8    | 1     | byte, octet, char
`WORD`  | 16   | 2     | word, short
`DWORD` | 32   | 4     | long, doubleword, longword, int, int32
`QWORD` | 64   | 8     | longword, long long, quadword, int64
n/a     | 128  | 16    | octaword, double quadword (for data heavy maths)

**TRIVIA**: The `WORD` type actually refers to the largest integer the CPU can
process in a single instruction, but that was back when Intel 8086 processors
were `16`-bit. Though processor capabilities have improved, the Intel manuals, and
therefore just about everything else, still refer to it as in the table above.
However, you may find specialized processor documentation that applies the original 
definition to very new or very old hardware. Just read the manufacturer's manual
to be sure you know what you are working with.

### x86 Instruction Data Structure:

The length of any instruction must not exceed `15`-bytes, or the processor will
trigger an exception.

#### Data structure of a single instruction

 0-4 bytes   | 1-3 bytes   | 0-1 byte      | 0-1 byte                 | 0,1,2,4 bytes     | 0,1,2,4,8 bytes |
-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
 `Prefix`    | `Opcode`    | `Mod-Reg R/M` | `Scale-Index-Base (SIB)` | `Displacement`    | `Immediate`     |

#### The Prefix

Each prefix byte is optional, but must appear in the following order:

Prefix | Bytes | Effect
-|-|-
[`Legacy`](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#Legacy_Prefixes)<br><br><br><br><br>| `0xf0`, `0xf2`, `0xf3`,<br>`0x2e`, `0x36`, `0x3e`,<br>`0x26`, `0x64`, `0x65`,<br>`0x2e`, `0x3e`, `0x66`,<br>`0x67` | Mandatory for some older instructions.<br><br><br><br><br>
[`REX`](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#REX_prefix) | `0b0100WRXB` | Enables 64-bit operand size and extended registers.
[`VEX/XOP`](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#VEX.2FXOP_opcodes) | _2-3 bytes, complex_      | Vector [math] extensions (3 operands)

##### Segment Register Prefix Byte

These are mostly relevant to `Real` and `Protected` modes, which have
a related Global Descriptor Table (GDT).

Mnemonic | Byte | Name | Legacy x86 Purpose | x64 Purpose
-|-|-|-|-
`SS` | `0x2e` | Stack Segment | Pointer to process stack. | Pointer to `0x0`; unused.
`CS` | `0x36` | Code Segment | Pointer to process code. | Pointer to `0x0`; unused.
`DS` | `0x3e` | Data Segment | Pointer to process data. (ie. strings) | Pointer to `0x0`; unused.
`ES` | `0x26` | Extra Segment | Pointer to extra data. (User defined) | Pointer to `0x0`; unused.
`FS` | `0x64` | F Segment | Pointer to extra data. (User defined) | Pointer to thread-local process data.
`GS` | `0x65` | G Segment | Pointer to extra data. (User defined) | Pointer to thread-local process data.

These were designed for extended range, userland stability, and security--but were eventually outmoded by the
immense/unfathomable range provided by `64`-bit address space, and in favor of paging tables.

##### REX Prefix Byte Data Structure (8 bits)

Field    | Bit Length | Effect
---------|------------|-------
`0b0100` | 4          | Constant; recognizable magic prefix.
`W`      | 1          | `1`: 64-bit operand size (ie. `RAX`)<br>`0`: Default operand size (usually 32-bit, but per-instruction)
`R`      | 1          | `1`: Prepend `MODRM.(R)eg` by `1`-bit to map registers `R8`-`R15`.
`X`      | 1          | `1`: Prepend `SIB.inde(X)` by `1`-bit to map registers `R8`-`R15`.
`B`      | 1          | `1`: Prepend `MODRM.rm` and `SIB.(B)ase` by `1`-bit to map registers `R8`-`R15`.

Trivia:
- In theory, only one `REX` prefix should be used. In practice, only the last one is taken into account.
- A `REX` prefix before a `Legacy` prefix is silently ignored.

### The Operation Code (Opcode)

You can think of these as hardware level functions. When there are bugs in these
functions, we have to wait until the next model of CPU is out to replace them.
(ie. [Meltdown and Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) vulnerabilities announced in 2018)

Knowledge of less than `25` mnemonics from the very [first set of 8086 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086/8088_instructions)
from 1976 are all that is required to build a basic program. Learn these first:
`ADD`, `CALL`, `CMP`, `DEC`, `DIV`, `HLT`, `IDIV`, `IMUL`, `INC`, `INT`, `INTO`,
`IRET`, `JNZ`, `JMP`, `LEA`, `MOV`, `MUL`, `POP`, `PUSH`, `RET`, `RETN`, `SUB`,
`XOR`.
In total there are around `560` [unique mnemonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings), with more added each year
through extensions such as MMX, SIMD, 3DNow, and the latest hardware-level AES
and SHA cryptography.

When converting a mnemonic like `XOR` to the correct byte in machine code, you
realize there it is not a single function--but a collection of [more than 20](http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/XOR.html)
separate [function overloads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading)--where
each implementation is specialized by the type of operands it can accept.
So, if one were to [browse a table showing all function overloads by opcode byte](http://ref.x86asm.net/geek64.html),
you would find more than `1,070` in total, not including [undocumented opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Undocumented_instructions) 
which people continue to discover through reverse engineering.

- **Primary Opcodes:**
  In the first release of x86, we had only `1`-byte opcodes.
- **Secondary Opcodes:**
  Future opcodes made room by prefixing the escape byte `0xf0`. These are `2`-byte opcodes.
- **Opcode Extension:**
  If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the `3`-bit
  `MODRM.reg` field is considered an extension of the opcode. Since it can only
  be a value 0-7, it is noted as `/digit (Opcode)` like `0xda/0 FIADD`,
  where `0` is the value of the opcode extension. 
- **Multi-Byte Opcodes:**
  Eventually, escape sequences `0x0f38` and `0x0f3a` made way for `3`-byte
  opcodes.

So, the operation code can be `1-3` bytes in length, but the last byte is considered **primary**.

#### Opcode Special Fields in the Primary Opcode Data structure (8-bits)

Not every primary opcode byte has special fields, but when one does, its important to understand its meaning and
possible values:

7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|Special Field|Meaning|Example

**NOTE:** When the alias is shown with mixed case letters, lowercase are `0` and uppercase are `1`. (ie. `tTtN` is `0b0101`)

#### Operand types

Some opcodes accept 0, 1, 2, or 3 operands.  
You will see these referred to by how they are passed via the `Mod-Reg R/M` byte,  
in which case there are 3 types of operands an opcode can accept:

Operand Type | Notation | Description
-|-|-
`Immediate` | `imm<bits>` | Binary value fitting entirely within the instruction.
`Register`<br><br>|`r<bits>`| `3`-bit reference to one of eight on-processor General Purpose Registers,<br>which is expected to already hold a valid value.
`Memory` |`m<bits>`| A pointer to system address space, where another value begins.

Where `<bits>` is one of `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, or `128`.

### The `Immediate` Operand Type

We will discuss this type first because it is the simplest.

Some instructions use data encoded in the instruction itself as a source operand.
Arithmetic instructions allow the source operand to  be an immediate value.
The maximum value allowed for an immediate operand varies among instructions,
but can never be greater than the maximum value of an unsigned doubleword
integer (2Â³Â²).

For example, `0x142f` is the immediate operand in this instruction:

> `ADD EAX, 142fh`

The size of the immediate operand is determined by the opcode.

### The `Register` Operand Type

This type is the next simplest. It only requires `1` byte, the `Mod-Reg R/M` byte,  
which can specify one of the following tuple combinations:

2-bits (0-4)<br>`MODRM.mod`|3-bits (0-7)<br>`MODRM.reg` (reg/opcode)|3-bits (0-7)<br>`MODRM.rm` (register/memory)
-|-|-
`0b11`|`opcode extension`|`register`
`0b11`|`register`|`register`
`0b00`<br>`0b01`<br>`0b10`|`register`<br><br><br>|`memory` addressing mode<br>(via subsequent `Scale-Index-Base` byte)<br><br>

When we reference a `register` in `MODRM.reg` or `MODRM.rm`,
we are expecting that the register holds the value the operation needs.

Example:
> `MOV EAX, ECX`

But in the third case above, we can also place references to a `register` in
`SIB.index` and `SIB.base`, which means that the register holds a [memory] address,
that the CPU will dereference, and instead return a value held at that address.

Example:
> `MOV EAX, [ECX]`

### Mapping the Width of an Operand

The width of a `register` or `memory` address operand (`8`/`16`/`32`/`64`/`128` bits)  
is determined by _several_ factors, of which these are some:

Factors, Highest Precedence First|||||||||
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
`REX.W=1` Prefix                 |â|â|â|â|â|â|â|â
L Flag in Code Segment Descriptor|â|â|â|â|â|â|â|â
`0x66` Operand-Size Prefix       |â|â|â|â|â|â|â|â
`0x67` Address-Size Prefix       |â|â|â|â|â|â|â|â
`64`-bit `Long` operating `mode` |â|â|â|â|â|â|â|â
**Effective Operand Size**       |**32**|**32**|**16**|**16**|**64**|**64**|**64**|**64**
**Effective Address Size**       |**64**|**32**|**64**|**32**|**64**|**32**|**64**|**32**

What the opcode defines as acceptable operand widths also matters.

### The General Purpose Registers

Once you know the width of the register holding a value or an address to dereference, its simply a matter of mapping
`3`-bits to one of eight registers (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `BP`, `SP`, `SI`, `DI`). 
In `Long` mode there is an extra `4`th bit provided by `REX`/`VEX`/`XOP` prefixes, which unlocks eight additional registers (`R8-15`). 
All of these are `64`-bit registers, but the operand width (discussed above) determines how many bits you are actually reading/writing per-instruction.

The exact meaning of the values held by each register are imbued by a combination of the opcodes, and [calling conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions)
determined in the context of your operating system and the compiler that assembled your program. But it is helpful to know a few general meanings that are universal:

Register|Name|Commonly used as
-|-|-
`A`|**Accumulator**|Return value, especially the sum of arithmetic operations.
`B`|**Base index**|Starting point of an array or list structure.
`C`|**Counter**|Used by loops ie. the `i` in `for(int i=0; i<9; i++)`
`D`|**Data**|Extended space for accumulator.<br>(ie. `32`-bit mode will combine `EAX+EDX` to work on `64`-bit values)
`BP`|**Base Pointer**|Pointer to address of current stack frame.<br>(where function parameters end, and local variables begin)
`SP`|**Stack Pointer**|Pointer to address of last bytes `PUSH`ed to memory.
`SI`|**Source Index**|Starting point of unbounded stream data, especially a string.
`DI`|**Destination Index**|Ending point of unbounded data, especially in slicing operations.

As a helpful mnemonic convention when programming assembly and referencing documentation, Intel defines a set of prefix
(`R`=`64`-bit, `E`=`32`-bit, none=`16`-bit) and suffix (`X`/`D`=`DWORD`, `W`=`WORD`, `L/B`=Low `BYTE`, `H`=High `BYTE`)
when referring to these registers, which describes both a) operand width, and b) where those bits are located within the full register.

```
                            | If most significant byte first (little-endian)
                A register [0100011101001111010011110100010001001010010011110100001000100001]
                    offset  0       8       16             32                             64
          (Low 8-bits)  AL  |<----->|       |              |                               |
         (High 8-bits)  AH          |<----->|              |                               |
         (Low 16-bits)  AX  |<------------->|              |                               |
         (Low 32-bits) EAX  |<---------------------------->|                               |
(Full 64-bit register) RAX  |<------------------------------------------------------------>|
```

While there are several places you may reference a register, including `MODRM.reg`, `MODRM.rm`, `SIB.index`, `SIB.base`,
and `PO.reg`, you'll find they all use the same `3` or `4`-bit mapping convention, as follows:

|Register<br>Reference|(`3`-bit / `4th`-bit=`0b1`)<br>Low `8`-bitsÂ³|<br>High `8`-bitsÂ¹ Â³|<br>Low `16`-bits|<br>Low `32`-bitsâ´|<br>Full `64`-bit Register
-|-|-|-|-|-
`0b000`|`AL`/`R8B`   |    |`AX`/`R8W` |`EAX`/`R8D` |`RAX`/`R8` 
`0b001`|`CL`/`R9B`   |    |`CX`/`R9W` |`ECX`/`R9D` |`RCX`/`R9` 
`0b010`|`DL`/`R10B`  |    |`DX`/`R10W`|`EDX`/`R10D`|`RDX`/`R10`
`0b011`|`BL`/`R11B`  |    |`BX`/`R11W`|`EBX`/`R11D`|`RBX`/`R11`
`0b100`|`SPL`Â²/`R12B`|`AH`|`SP`/`R12W`|`ESP`/`R12D`|`RSP`/`R12`
`0b101`|`BPL`Â²/`R13B`|`CH`|`BP`/`R13W`|`EBP`/`R13D`|`RBP`/`R13`
`0b110`|`SIL`Â²/`R14B`|`DH`|`SI`/`R14W`|`ESI`/`R14D`|`RSI`/`R14`
`0b111`|`DIL`Â²/`R15B`|`BH`|`DI`/`R15W`|`EDI`/`R15D`|`RDI`/`R15`

**NOTES:**

1. The high `8`-bit registers (`AH`, `CH`, `DH`, `BH` ) are not addressable when a `REX` prefix is used.
2. These low `8`-bit registers (`SPL`, `BPL`, `SIL`, `DIL`) are only addressable when a `REX` prefix is used.  
   This is because the `3`-bit mappings used for them are overlapping, as seen in the footnote and table above.  
   In fact, the lower `8` bytes of `SP`, `BP`, `SI`, and `DI` were not even addressable before x64 `Long` mode.
3. Both high and low `8`-bit registers are only directly addressable from `Real` mode or `Virtual 8086` mode,  
   but you can always grab the larger-width version of the same register, and it will contain those bytes, of course.
4. _WARNING:_ `32`-bit registers are zero-extended when used in `Long` mode.  
   (ie. `INC EAX` will zero-fill all of `RAX`, but `INC AL` or `INC AX` will not.)

### The `Memory` Address Operand

This is the most complex type of operand, but not too complex.  
If either or both of your source and destination operands are inside system address space,  
you will have to use these `2-3` bytes:

Data Structure|Size|Required
-|-|-
`Mod-Reg R/M` | `8`-bits | Required
`Scale-Index-Base (SIB)` | `8`-bits | Required
`Displacement` | `0`/`8`/`16`/`32`-bits | Optional

The structure of `SIB` is, briefly:

`2`-bits | `3`-bits | `3`-bits
-|-|-
`Scale` | `Index` | `Base`

When calculating the address, the formula is, generally:

> **Real Address** = `Segment` + `SIB.base` + (`SIB.index` Ã `SIB.scale`) + `Displacement`

Where:

Variable|Meaning
-|-
`Segment`|Augend to the following variables. Remember most segments are mapped to `0x00` in `Long` mode.
`SIB.base`|Refers to a register, whose value holds the augend to the product of `SIB.scale` and `SIB.index`.
`SIB.scale`|Multiplicand of `SIB.index`: `0b00`=Ã1, `0b01`=Ã2, `0b10`=Ã4, `0b11`=Ã8
`SIB.index`|Refers to a register, whose value holds the multiplier of `SIB.scale`.
`Displacement`<br><br>| Literal value, holds an actual relative address; an addend to all previous variables.<br>If no `SIB` byte is present in `32`-bit mode, address is relative to `RIP`/`EIP` instruction pointer.

While the order always remains the same, certain variables are omitted according to the
current `addressing mode`. This is determined by `MODRM.mod`; when one of its
three encodings references a `memory` address--`0b00`, `0b01`, or `0b10`--it is
then combined with the `MODRM.rm` field, for a total of 24 possibilities, and
these specify the various memory addressing modes, as follows:

With `16`-bit registers (`Real` or `Protected` modes):

|`MODRM.mod`|`MODRM.rm`||||||||
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
||`0b000`<br>`AX`|`0b001`<br>`CX`|`0b010`<br>`DX`|`0b011`<br>`BX`|`0b100`<br>`SP`|`0b101`<br>`BP`Â¹|`0b110`<br>`SI`|`0b111`<br>`DI`

**NOTES:**  
1. The default segment register is `SS` for the `BP` register, `DS` for everything else.
2. `disp<bits>` means `Displacement` with a width of said `<bits>`.  
3. _Warning:_ `disp8` is [sign-extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_extension) wherever it is allowed to be used.
4. The `SIB` byte cannot be used in `Real` mode.

With `32`-bit (`Protected` or `Long` modes) and `64`-bit registers (`Long` mode):

**NOTES:**
1. Variable `B` represents that a prefix `REX.B`, `VEX.B`, or `XOP.B` is present, enabling `R8-R15` `MODRM.rm` and `SIB.base` registers.
2. In `Protected` mode, this is actually just zero-based `0+disp32` displacement addressing.  
   But `Long` mode changes this to `RIP`-relative by default, or `EIP`-relatve (when `0x67` Address-Size Prefix is also present).  
   If you want zero-based behavior in `Long` mode, you must use the one of the `SIB` byte forms and make its address effectively zero.
3. Variable `X` represents that a prefix `REX.X`, `VEX.X`, or `XOP.X` is present, enabling `R8-R15` `SIB.index` registers.
4. Format of this column is a list of `4`-bit unsigned decimal ranges, to keep the table compact.

# Appendix: Let's Manually Assemble an Instruction!

Let's translate the following [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc0.html)-compatible assembly instruction into
`32`/`64`-bit compatible machine code:

opcode|operand1|operand2
-|-|-
`XOR`|`CL,`|`[12H]`

Beginning with the `opcode` byte first, consulting the 
[Intel IA-32 manual, Volume 2C, Chapter 5, "XOR"](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf#page=2404)
--we find `0x32 XOR` which states a) it requires 2 operands, b) the operands
have a direction, and the first operand is the destination, c) the first operand
is a register of `8`-bits width, d) the second operand is also `8`-bit but can be
either a `register` or `memory` address, and e) the destination register `CL` will be
overridden to contain the result of the operation. This fits our case above,
because the first operand is `CL` (`L` meaning lower `8`-bits of the `C` register),
and the second operand is a reference the the value stored in memory at `0x12`
(a direct/absolute pointer or address reference). It doesn't look like we need
any prefix bytes to get the operand sizes we want.

As an interesting observational aside, this opcode has `special fields` of `001100dw`:
- `d=1` because the register is the destination.
- `w=0` because the operands (`r/8`,`imm8`) are `8`-bit.

Now we know we need a `ModR/M` byte, because the opcode requires it; a) it requires
more than zero operands, and b) they are not defined within the opcode or any
prefix, and c) there is no `Immediate` operand. So again we consult the 
[Intel manual, Volume 2A, Chapter 2, Section 2.1.5 "Addressing-Mode Encoding of ModR/M and SIB Bytes", Table 2-2 "32-Bit Addressing Forms with the ModR/M Byte"](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf#page=510).
We know the first operand is going to be our destination register, `CL`, so we see that maps to `REG=001b`. 
Next we look for an `Effective Address` formula which matches our second operand,
which is a `displacement` with no `register` (and therefore no `segment`, `base`,
`scale`, or `index`). The nearest match is going to be `disp32`, but reading the
table is tricky because of the footnotes. Basically our formula is not in that
table, the one we want requires a `SIB` byte noted as `[--][--]`, which tells us
we need to specify `Mod=0b00`, `R/M=0b100` to enable the `SIB` byte. Our second byte
is therefore `0b00001100` or `0x0C`.

We know the `SIB` byte, if it is used, always follows the `ModR/M` byte, so we continue to the next 
[Table 2-3 "32-Bit Addressing Forms with the SIB Byte" in the Intel manual](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf#page=511),
and look for the combination of `Scale`, `Index`, and `Base` values which will
give us the `disp32` formula we need. Notice there is a footnote `[*]`, this
basically tells us to specify `Scale=00b`, `Index=100b`, `Base=101b` which means
`disp32` with no `index`, no `scale`, and no `base`. So our third byte is now
`0x25`.

We know the `Displacement` byte, if used, always follows the `ModR/M` and `SIB`
byte, so here we simply specify our `32`-bit unsigned integer value in 
little-endian, meaning our next four bytes are `0x12000000`.

Finally, we have our machine code:

```
XOR CL, [12H] = 00110010 00001100 00100101 00010010 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 32 0c 25 12 00 00 00
```

This instruction works in both `32`-bit `Protected` mode and `64`-bit `Long` mode.

And here is the `16`-bit version for `Real` mode:

```
XOR CL, [12H] = 00110010 00001110 00010010 00000000 = 32 0e 12 00
```

# Appendix: x86 Extensions

As new models of the x86 family are released, the instruction set is extended with new features.
Here we provide a chronologically ordered summary of what was added, when, and why.

## History of the FPU

The floating point featureset deserves its own history.

In [1978](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535019/computer-hardware/timeline--a-brief-history-of-the-x86-microprocessor.html), Intel introduced
the [8086](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Original_8086/8088_instructions) CPU architecture.
All processors at the time would perform _integer_ math only.
This meant floating-point precision had to be emulated per-application in the software layer,
which was slow, and difficult for the average programmer.

In 1980, Intel releases the [8087](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8087)
math co-processor, a separate chip designed to be installed in parallel to the 8086 CPU,
exclusively for carrying out hardware-optimized mathematical operations with floating point numbers.
This introduced [+83 new hardware-optimized instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#x87_floating-point_instructions) all beginning with the letter `F`.

It would be another 9 years before the Intel 80486, the first CPU with a built-in math co-processor. 
This introduced [+8 new 80-bit registers](https://image1.slideserve.com/3151415/cpu-state-32-bit-x86-n.jpg) called `ST0`-`ST7`.
The instruction set remains the same for backward-compatibility.

## Single Instruction, Multiple Data (`SIMD`) + Digital Signal Processing

[SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) is a classification of parallel processing strategy,
where multiple processors perform the same operation on multiple data points, simultaneously;
allowing you to scale by processing N datas in the same number of clock cycles as just one data.

Such machines exploit data level parallelism, but not concurrency: there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but only a single process (instruction) at a given moment.

Many ISA/PCI peripherial manufacturers (e.g., [Creative Sound Blaster 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16)) were becoming popular for providing specialized digital signal processors which utilized SIMD.

Eventually, Intel reasoned that it made sense to centralize that technology into the CPU.

## Intel MMX vs. AMD 3DNow!

In 1997, Intel released the P5-based Pentium line of microprocessors, designated as "Pentium with [MMX Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set))".
This was effectively SIMD/DSP technology built-into the CPU. It introduced [+60 new instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#MMX_instructions), 
but [re-used the 80-bit FPU registers](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/7/5/0/2/0/29529-figure-1.jpg) `ST0-7`, renaming the lower `64`-bits `MMX0-7`.

The following year, AMD answered with the K6-2 processor featuring all the MMX instructions plus a few enhancements. The two companies competed in court fiercely over naming and rights to use the technology. AMD would eventually brand theirs as [3DNow!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DNow!)

These implementations both proved unpopular and are basically now deprecated, though you can still find their registers and instructions usable in modern processors.

## Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE)

By 1999, Intel announced SSE as the successor to Intel MMX,
which added [+70 new instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions#SSE_instructions) and [+8 new 128-bit registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions#Registers) `XMM0-7`... later, when `amd64` introduced +8 more registers `XMM8-15`, Intel followed suit.

This addressed two main problems: a) MMX only worked with integers, and b) switching between
MMX/FPU instructions was too inefficient for practical use, because they had to share the same FPU registers.

There have been several versions of SSE to date, including
[`SSE`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE_instructions),
[`SSE2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE2_instructions),
[`SSE3`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE3_instructions),
[`SSSE3`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSSE3_instructions),
[`SSE4a`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE4a),
[`SSE4.1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE4.1),
and the latest as of this writing
[`SSE4.2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE4.2).
The latest version is backward compatible to the first version.

There is also the aborted AMD bastard child [`SSE5`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#SSE5_derived_instructions) or `XOP` which only existed briefly in one processor and was then abandoned after it was rejected by Intel.

While the names, implementations, and their exact instruction sets are different, the concept has remained the same--**SIMD**; whether you're doing video encoding, audio synthesis, or streaming textures to a GPU--you optimize by performing a single operation across a nice matrix/vector of floating point data whenever possible.

## Advanced Vector Extensions ([AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#AVX) / [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#AVX2) / [AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#AVX-512))

Today, certain processors designed for heavy workloads offer SIMD instruction sets that operate on even bigger registers:

- **AVX:** Sixteen new 256-bit registers (`YMM0-15`), with the XMM registers occupying the lower 128 bits of the same numbered `YMM` register.
- **AVX-512:** Thirty-two new 512-bit registers (`ZMM0-31`), with same numbered `YMM` and `XMM` registers occupying the lower 256 and 128 bits of the `ZMM` register.

## Virtualization ([Intel VT-x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_Intel_VT-x) / [AMD-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_AMD-V))

Leveraged by popular virtual machines / hypervisors to get closer-to-native performance for their guest OS.

## Cryptography ([AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Intel_AES_instructions), [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Intel_SHA_instructions))

Recently, Intel CPUs come with hardware implementations of these popular crypto functions for an easy performance boost.

# Floating Point Numbers (IEEE-754)

Floats come in various sizes. When serialized for compact transmission over the
network, a clever dev may try to encode them as a string, or a tuple of 1-byte
integers (integer and mantissa, optionally an exponent). But when you need the
processor to do really quick, especially bulk, binary floating point math, the
following is the standard form used everywhere.

SIMD instructions operate almost exclusively on `ST0-7`, `MMX0-7`, and more recently
the `XMM0-15` registers. When utilizing the high-precision `80`/`128`-bit values,
you may need to perform multiple `MOV` and `PUSH` operations to fill the entire
register, since the other registers and `immediate` operands are much smaller.
As an optimization, some instructions accept a memory pointer operand to read/write
a long array of floats to/from a block of memory in one operation.

### Data Structure:

- **`1`-bit Sign** (`0`=positive)  
- **`8`-bit base2 Exponent add `+127` bias** ([why not signed two's compliment?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2835476))  
  Take the whole number integer part, convert to binary, remove any [insignificant] 0 prefixes, count digits, minus one, that's the binary exponent
  convert that binary exponent (say, 8 digits) to binary and add +127
- **`23`-bit Mantissa a.k.a. Significand**  
  This is the combination of the integer and fractional parts concatenated.  
  The integer part is encoded as a simple unsigned int.  
  However, the fractional part is encoded as a base2 binary fraction,
  which commonly results in a [continued fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) pattern,  
  which gets truncated--and can lead to infamous FPU rounding errors if not handled carefully.  
  ex: `3.1f` = `0b11` + `0b000 1100 1100 1100 1100 110...` _(the pattern would repeat infinitely if not truncated)_  
  This is stored little-endian so any zero-fill happens on the right side.

## Let's manually encode `1.0f`!

- **sign:** `0b0` = a positive number  
- **mantissa:** `0b1` + `0b0` zero-extended  
  _(It is easier to calculate in this order because the mantissa value informs the exponent value.)_
- **exponent:** `0d0` + `0d127` = `0d127` = `0b01111111`  

```
IEEE-754 32-bit (single precision) Floating Point (x86; little-endian)

  offset  0  1          10                         32
  single [0  0111 1111  1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000] = 0x3f800000 = 1.0f
          |  |       |  |                          |
   sign   1  |       |  |                          |
exponent     |<--8-->|  |                          |
mantissa                |<-----------23----------->|
```

The structure is the same for `64`-bit (`double` precision) floats
except the exponent has `11` bits, and a bias of `+1023`.

The exponent bit has a four magic values which have reserved special meanings:

Exponent | Mantissa | Meaning
-|-|-
`0b0` | `0b0` | zero (`0d0`)
`0b0` | non-zero | denormalized
all `0b1`'s | `0b0` | `Infinity`
all `0b1`'s | non-zero | `NaN` Â¹

**NOTES**:
1. You can hide data inside the mantissa of `NaN` structures.  
   Some compilers use this to specify more precise reason codes (ie. if `NaN` resulted from failed computation.)

# Appendix: Stack vs. Heap

The stack is a data structure in memory the processor can understand and maintain,
used for holding variables that wouldn't fit in CPU registers. Its structure is
a **Last-In, First-Out** (`LIFO`) queue, growing from bottom (highest address range)
to top (approaching zero), like plates returning to a dishwasher in a cafeteria.

Typical candidates for the stack include CPU register data which is:
- Too long or too many to fit in the desired registers.
- Backed up prior and then restored after, so that your function may run
without leaving unwanted traces or side-effects on functions that will follow.
- Stateful data with a lifetime longer than a single opcode instruction, which
  includes almost every higher-than-assembly programming language feature (ie.
  concepts like `function`, `for...loop`, multi-variable `expressions`, etc.) and
  the `Stack Frame`, explained below.

## The Stack Frame data structure

Pretend we have a function:
```as3
function playSound(name:string, volume:int, wait:bool):bool {
  var basePath = "C:\Sounds\";
  var delay = 1000;
  // ...
  return true;
}
```

and we execute it like:

```as3
playSound('moo.wav', 20, false);
```

Your compiler's operating system and 
[calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions)
determines exactly how these should be laid out in stack, but let's look at the common
right-to-left **C Declaration** ([`cdecl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl)) convention, and we'll assume we're operating
in `32`-bit `Protected` mode.

Memory address|Little-endian value|Variable name|Relative offset|Length|Significance
-|-|-|-|-|-
`0x00000000`|?|?|?|?|Random data, not ours
`...`|||||
|`0xabcd3FE8`|`0x03e80000`|`delay`|[`EBP`-`8`]|`32`-bits|2nd local variable
|`0xabcd3FEC`|Address of `"C:\Sounds\"` string in `DS`|`basePath`|[`EBP`-`4`]|`32`-bits|1st local variable
|`0xabcd3FF0`|?|**Frame Pointer** (`FP`)|[`EBP`]|`32`-bits|Backup of the `EBP` value from before our function began

`PUSH` and `POP` instructions add/remove stack data, and decrement/increment the 
`SP` register which points to the top of the stack; the most recent byte written.
The `BP` register is for use by the programmer, conventionally pointing at the byte
occuring just prior to the current function's first local variable, a quick reference
which you can offset positively to reach function arguments, or negatively to reach
local variables.

By the time the function returns, everything it added has been removed again.
Registers that held important values before the function began are now returned
to their original values. The only thing remaining on the stack from this function
is maybe a return value. This means any data which you wish to persist beyond the 
lifetime of a function _cannot_ exist on the stack. (Unless you get creative with
the return value or referencing data from a calling function occuring earlier in
the calling hierarchy.)

## The Heap data structure

By now you'll see that the heap is the only place for long-lived data structures,
which have no means to persist in either the register or the stack; heap is the
place for "everything else."

The structure of the heap is determined by the programmer. It is nothing more
than a blank slice of bytes for writing from a random section of free memory,
typically reserved to an application upon `malloc()` request, and recycled upon
`free()` or process end by the operating system, or virtual machine, depending
on the environment.

Some applications like Java will reserve a large block of memory on process start,
and have a very complex implementation of garbage collection so that they can
work entirely in that single allocation for the life of the process. Others like
the typical C/C++ application will reserve and free many small blocks of memory,
repeatedly throughout the life of the process, relying on the operating system
to try to keep it organized--which can lead to problems with alignment, fragmentation,
and performance--as going back to the OS for more memory can be slow, and the OS
is allowed to say "no", ie.:

- **Out-of-memory (OOM):** Your extreme inefficiency, or that of another process, has exhausted the machines resources.
- **Segmentation fault (segfault):** Security/stability related; you're requesting an address within a code or data segment of a process that does not belong to you.

# Appendix: Big vs. Little Endianness

This only applies at the byte level. It is the order which bytes are read by the
processor. The x86 processor expects little-endian, which means the most significant
byte is to the left.

ie. `0d2` is `0x02000000` in `32`-bit little-endian, and `0d-2` is `0xfeffffff` in `32`-bit little-endian,  
where as the same values in big endian would be `0x00000002` and `0xfffffffe`.

**WARNING:** Sometimes tools like debuggers, disassemblers, calculators, etc. will
print the values opposite to what you are expecting for the architecture in context.
In these cases, they are simply trying to be too helpful. Be aware of the byte order,
and maybe check with a hex editor or multiple tools to be certain when it matters.

**QUIRK:** Registers are typically drawn with the `EAX`, `AX`, `AH`, `AL` on the right-hand
side, but in fact if you set a value like `0d24` in `RAX` and then print the values
of `RAX`, `EAX`, `AX`, `AL` you will see they all equal `0d24`, and `AH` equals `0d0`,
which means that their slices all actually begin from the most significant byte first.
I like to think that the registers are stored little endian too, for consistency,
and that all those drawings are backwards. Its uncommon to set `RAX` only to select
`EAX`, so it may not matter, but its a little trivia to be aware of.

# Appendix: Other Registers

As you master your understanding of x86 architecture, there are a few registers
which exist but don't typically get talked about until the very end:

- [FLAGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register_%28computing%29)
- [Global Descriptor Table (GDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table)
- [Local Descriptor Table (LDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table)
- [Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_descriptor_table)
- [Task Register (TR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment#Task_register)
- The **Instruction Pointer** (`IP`) register points to the first byte of the next instruction in memory, but
  cannot be accessed by the programmer directly.

# Appendix: Addressing Modes and Pointers

There is a common vernacular across all cpu architectures when describing pointers,
which we'll attempt to summarize here.

## Addressing Modes

Term | Description
-|-
**implied** | pre-determined by opcode; no way to affect
**stack** | implied, but affected by stack push/pop
**register** | src/dst operand is a register<br>**pro:** fast; within cpu.
**pc-relative** | signed (-128,+127) constant disp8 from IP program counter (short jmp/addr)<br>**pro:** fast; within instruction. ideal for jmp, branching, threading, fwd/bkwd<br>**con:** limited max range
**direct** | memory address constant via displacement or immediate<br>**pro:** fast; within instruction<br>**con:** unchangeable; addr should not be modified once running/cpu-cached<br>
**indirect** | [register or memory] address is pointer to another memory address<br>only variations of JMP and CALL will automatically dereference an indirect address.<br>otherwise, manual dereferencing requires multiple instructions.<br>**pro:** can change address pointed to at runtime<br>**con:** slow; requires two or more memory accesses, and the memory to store them

### Definitions

**Effective addresses** are any operand to an instruction which references memory.

Calculated in some of the following ways:

- **indexed offset:**
  ```
  segment + base + (scale * index) + displacement
  ```
  A segment address is always implied unless you override the selector.  
  The rest is optional.  
  Index defaults to 1 while scale, base, displacement default to 0.

- **near pointer** "segment_register:offset" or just "offset":  
    address is relative to given segment register,  
    otherwise relative to the default segment--which is 
    usually DS but may vary by instruction.  
    The SEGMENT REGISTERS are: CS, DS, FS, ES, and SS
    
- **far pointer** "segment_selector:offset" data type:  
    two addr concat in single operand  
    the segment_selector refers to the GDT which refers to a protected memory page  
    the offset is the address relative to that.

# Appendix: Brief History of Assemblers

One of the earliest commercial-grade assembler tools was **Microsoft Macro Assembler** (`MASM`) in 1981.
It was initially marketed for commercial use, and included documentation.
Beginning with v7 (1991) it was only available packaged with various
Microsoft SDKs and C compilers, and its license required you to own a copy of
Visual Studio. Since then its documentation has also become sparse and difficult
to get ahold of.

Its early influence led to many derivatives; importantly, it inspired the
open-source **Netwide Assembler** (`NASM`) project, which is basically MASM with
improvements that allow it to work across all platforms.

Some hardcore enthusiasts still author primarily in MASM and hoan their techniques
by collecting, preserving, and resharing rare code artifacts from fellow enthusiasts.

Today there are numerous assemblers to choose from, including Richard Stallman's
GNU Assembler (`GAS`) which ships with Linux coreutils, but these are the most
common choices.

# Appendix: Windows PE/COFF Binary format

Windows executables (`*.exe`, `*.dll`) use **Portable Executable** (`PE`) format,
which is a wrapper around and **Component Object File Format** (`COFF`), which is
used by binary linker files (`*.obj`, `*.lib`). Technically Windows 64-bit uses
a version internally called PE32+.

A linker (ie. `link.exe`, `cl.exe`, `ld`, etc.) is basically designed to parse one
or more `COFF` files, and wrap them into a single executable with a `PE` header.

Here is some useful trivia about that:
- `.obj` is Windows COFF, `.o` is the equivalent Linux ELF; same purpose, different formats.
- Microsoft COFF is an extended version of the original by AT&T.
- `.obj` and `.lib` files contain a simple table data structure mapping
  unique ASCII string symbol names to code or address offsets in another file.
- `.lib` may include source code (static), but most of the time (e.g., in Visual Studio)
  they are just header stubs (dynamic) with pointers to address offsets in a `.dll` which must
  match the exact release version and compiler used.
- Confusingly, there is no trivial way to tell static and dynamic `.lib` files apart,
  except that [dynamic] import libraries for DLLs will be much smaller than the
  matching static library would be.
- `.lib` files may only be used at compile time to build statically linked binaries.
- `.dll` files are intended to only be used at runtime to as dynamically linked binaries.
- Technically `.dll` files contain enough information that a reverse engineer could
  statically link them without a `.lib`, if they wanted to.
- If you only have a `.dll`, you may be missing the compile-time 
  constants passed as function arguments. These are typically shared in the form of
  a C header (`*.h`) file, as part of an SDK (e.g,
  [windows sdk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winmsg/wm-destroy)
  , [opengl sdk](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GLES2/gl2.h)),
  if the developer wants you to have them. 
  The other thing you may not have is the documentation about what inputs are valid,
  when, and what effect they have on the `.dll` functions.
  Though a determined hacker could successfully guess them by looking at example
  code which uses the `.dll`, or via fuzz testing.
- The version of `gcc` toolchain GNU linker (`ld`) ported to Windows can statically
  link using `.dll` inputs directly, which means it is able to implicitly synthesize
  the normally required but missing `.lib` stubs automagically!
- **Decorated names** or **mangled names** are a symbol naming convention used in the
  COFF files. They are a series of ASCII prefix and suffixes which guarantee that
  each function is named uniquely when merged into the same flat COFF table format.
  The additional data mangled into the name includes: 
    - The **function name**.
    - The **class name** that the function is a member of, if it is a member function.  
      This may include the class that encloses the class that contains the function, and so on.
    - The **namespace** the function belongs to, if it is part of a namespace.
    - The C function **parameter types**, in order.
    - The **calling convention**.
    - The **return type** of the function.
- You can decode decorated/mangled names using supplied tools, like so:
  ```
  "> C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\dumpbin.exe" /symbols "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\lib\amd64\msvcrt.lib"
  "> C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\undname.exe" "??$?RUTlsDtorNode@@@__crt_internal_free_policy@@QEBAXQEBUTlsDtorNode@@@Z"
  Undecoration of :- "??$?RUTlsDtorNode@@@__crt_internal_free_policy@@QEBAXQEBUTlsDtorNode@@@Z"
  is :- "public: void __cdecl __crt_internal_free_policy::operator()<struct TlsDtorNode>(struct TlsDtorNode const * __ptr64 const)const __ptr64"
  ```
